# Critical Fixes Applied to Controllable Shadow Generation

This document summarizes all Priority 1 and Priority 2 fixes applied to align the implementation with the paper specifications.

---

## Priority 1 Fixes (Critical Issues) ‚úÖ

### 1. Rectified Flow Interpolation Direction
**File**: `controllable_shadow/models/shadow_diffusion_model.py:146-158`

**Problem**: The interpolation went from clean‚Üínoise instead of noise‚Üíclean, causing the model to learn the opposite velocity field.

**Fix**:
```python
# BEFORE (WRONG):
x0 = encode_shadow(target)  # Clean
x1 = randn_like(x0)         # Noise
xt = (1-t)*x0 + t*x1        # Interpolates clean‚Üínoise

# AFTER (CORRECT):
x0 = randn_like(...)        # Noise
x1 = encode_shadow(target)  # Clean
xt = t*x1 + (1-t)*x0        # Interpolates noise‚Üíclean at t=0‚Üí1
```

**Impact**: This was causing the model to predict incorrect velocity directions during training, leading to failed convergence.

---

### 2. Single-Step Sampling Timestep
**File**: `controllable_shadow/models/shadow_diffusion_model.py:237-255`

**Problem**: Documentation was unclear about timestep value for single-step sampling.

**Fix**: Clarified that `t=0` is correct for single-step rectified flow, added detailed comments explaining the integration process.

```python
# Single-step sampling starts at t=0 (noise) and integrates over [0,1]
t = torch.zeros(batch_size, device=device)  # t=0 (start from noise)
velocity = self.unet(...)
x_final = x + velocity  # Integrate full trajectory in one step
```

**Impact**: Clarified implementation matches rectified flow theory.

---

### 3. Model Architecture Mismatch
**File**: `controllable_shadow/models/shadow_generator.py`

**Problem**: `ShadowGenerator` was instantiating `RectifiedFlowModel` (custom architecture) instead of `ShadowDiffusionModel` (SDXL-based as per paper).

**Fix**: Completely rewrote `ShadowGenerator` to use `ShadowDiffusionModel`:

```python
# BEFORE (WRONG):
from .rectified_flow import RectifiedFlowModel
self.diffusion_model = RectifiedFlowModel(...)

# AFTER (CORRECT):
from .shadow_diffusion_model import ShadowDiffusionModel
self.model = ShadowDiffusionModel(
    pretrained_model_name="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
    conditioning_strategy="additive",
    ...
)
```

**Impact**: Critical - was using completely wrong architecture. Now uses SDXL UNet as specified in paper.

---

### 4. VAE Encoding Mismatch
**File**: `controllable_shadow/models/shadow_generator.py`

**Problem**: Training used real SDXL VAE, but inference used fake encoding (avg_pool/interpolate).

**Fix**: Removed fake VAE methods, now uses actual VAE pipeline in both training and inference:

```python
# BEFORE (WRONG):
def _encode_to_vae_space(self, image):
    return F.avg_pool2d(image, kernel_size=8, stride=8)  # Fake!

# AFTER (CORRECT):
# Removed - now calls self.model.sample() which uses real VAE
shadow_map = self.model.sample(
    object_image=obj_tensor,
    mask=mask,
    theta=theta_tensor,
    ...
)
```

**Impact**: Critical - train/inference mismatch would cause complete failure. Now consistent.

## Priority 2 Fixes (Major Issues) ‚úÖ

### 5. Equation 7 Sinusoidal Embedding Formula
**File**: `controllable_shadow/models/conditioning.py:47-79`

**Problem**: Using `math.log` (natural log) without clarification - could be confused with `log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ`.

**Fix**: Added comments clarifying that natural log (ln) is correct for positional encodings:

```python
# œâ_i = 2^exponent ¬∑ ln(max_freq)
# Using natural log (ln) as is standard for positional encodings
omega_i = (2.0 ** exponent) * math.log(self.max_freq)
```

**Impact**: No code change needed - added documentation to prevent future confusion.

---

### 6. Light Parameter Validation
**File**: `controllable_shadow/models/conditioning.py:105-145`

**Problem**: No validation or clamping of input parameters. Users could pass out-of-range values.

**Fix**: Added validation and clamping with warnings:

```python
# Theta: [0¬∞, 45¬∞] - vertical shadow direction
theta_clamped = torch.clamp(theta, 0.0, 45.0)
if (theta != theta_clamped).any():
    print(f"Warning: theta values clamped to [0, 45]...")

# Phi: [0¬∞, 360¬∞] - horizontal shadow direction (wraps around)
phi_wrapped = phi % 360.0

# Size: [2, 8] - light source size (softness)
size_clamped = torch.clamp(size, 2.0, 8.0)
if (size != size_clamped).any():
    print(f"Warning: size values clamped to [2, 8]...")
```

**Impact**: Prevents invalid inputs, improves robustness.

---

### 7. Cross-Attention Removal
**File**: `controllable_shadow/models/sdxl_unet.py:70-105`

**Problem**: Cross-attention modules were replaced with `AttnProcessor()` but still computed attention.

**Fix**: Created proper `NoOpAttnProcessor` that returns input unchanged:

```python
class NoOpAttnProcessor:
    """No-op attention processor that returns input unchanged."""
    def __call__(self, attn, hidden_states, encoder_hidden_states=None, **kwargs):
        return hidden_states  # Skip computation entirely

# Apply to cross-attention only
for name, processor in self.unet.attn_processors.items():
    if "attn2" in name:  # attn2 is cross-attention
        attn_procs[name] = NoOpAttnProcessor()
    else:  # attn1 is self-attention (keep these)
        attn_procs[name] = AttnProcessor()
```

**Impact**: Saves computation and memory by truly skipping cross-attention.

---

### 8. Conditioning Injection Mechanism
**File**: `controllable_shadow/models/conditioned_unet.py:196-245`

**Problem**: Used monkey-patching (temporarily replacing `time_embedding` module) which is fragile.

**Fix**: Replaced with forward hooks for cleaner implementation:

```python
# BEFORE (FRAGILE):
self.unet.unet.time_embedding = CustomEmbedding(emb)  # Monkey-patch!
output = self.unet(...)
self.unet.unet.time_embedding = original_time_embedding  # Restore

# AFTER (CLEAN):
def embedding_hook(module, input, output):
    return self._custom_emb

hook_handle = self.unet.unet.time_embedding.register_forward_hook(embedding_hook)
try:
    output = self.unet(...)
finally:
    hook_handle.remove()  # Always clean up
```

**Impact**: More robust, cleaner code, proper cleanup guaranteed.

## Next Steps

1. **Run Tests**: Execute `python test_fixes.py` to validate all fixes
2. **Train Model**: Start training with `python train.py --dataset_type benchmark`
3. **Monitor Training**: Watch for:
   - Loss should decrease steadily
   - No NaN/Inf values
   - VAE should remain frozen
   - Single-step sampling should work after ~50k iterations

4. **Evaluate**: Test on benchmark dataset after training

## Notes

- First run will download SDXL weights (~6GB) from HuggingFace
- Training requires GPU with at least 16GB VRAM (use `--mixed_precision` if needed)
- All critical bugs that would prevent training have been fixed
- Implementation now matches paper specifications
